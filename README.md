This is my Multithread Search Engine Project Assignments that I did in the Computer Science Engineering lecture 333 at University of Washington. 

It could be broken into four seperate parts that functions as a Multi-Threaded Search Engine as a whole that is written in the C/C++ framework.
Here are the selective parts that I designed when working on those projects.
Including:
1) A handcrafted linkedlist and hashtable data structures in the native C language.

2) A search engine that utilizes the LinkedList and HashTable we hand crafted to implement a file system crawler, indexer and search engine in the native C language.(SearchShell.c)

3) A search engine that utilizes the LinkedList and HashTable container in the standard C++ library ,instead of handcrafted C ones, to implement a file system crawler, indexer and search engine in the native C/C++ language.
(SearchShell.cc)

4) A multithreaded wev server front-end to the SearchShell.cc file we created previously. 
(HttpServer.cc,HttpServer.h)

As well as the corresponding bug journals we have encountered along the creation and designing of the system.
